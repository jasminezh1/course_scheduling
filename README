scheduled.py is the complete version! To run the code, you only need to run this file.
    The linear programming formulation is written into the file "formulation.lp"
    The final assignments are written into the file "output.txt".

The folder data_files contains the relevant .csv files. The current files used are "courses_rooms4.csv", "courses_times4.csv", "overlap2.csv", "rooms_times4.csv", and "same.csv".

The folder generate_data contains the scripts that generate some of the random data. generate_random includes code to generate the "overlap.csv" and "same.csv". random_csv includes code to generate .csv files for a random set of rooms and times. make_graph.py produces the graphs used in the writeup.

The folder previous_attempts unsurprisingly contains versions of previous attempts. These should be ignored.
    basic.py is the very basic code -- small set of classes, rooms, times. currently issue where the wrong LP solver is used.
    weighted.py builds off basic.py and includes an objective function to minimizing the number of students affected by classes overlapping.
    different_times.py has rooms and classes be only be available at different variable length times, and classes scheduled at variable number of and certain rooms
