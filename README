basic.py is the very basic code -- small set of classes, rooms, times. currently issue where the wrong LP solver is used.
weighted.py builds off basic.py and includes an objective function to minimizing the number of students affected by classes overlapping.
different_times.py has rooms and classes be only be available at different variable length times, and classes scheduled at variable number of and certain rooms
